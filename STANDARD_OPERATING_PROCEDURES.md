## Adding a new image

Let's say the new image is `avalonia-base`.

1. After the GitHub Actions job finishes, go to <https://github.com/orgs/diskuv/packages/container/avalonia-base/settings> and go to the Danger Zone and change the visibility to Public.
2. Add a description of the image to [README.md](README.md).
